	// Why is this useful?
	// There is a "status" buffer that contains the number of pixels that have converged for a kernel launch.
	// It is a simple counter that threads of the kernel increment if the pixel corresponding to the thread has converged.
	// Because thread keep incrementing this counter, we need to reset it to 0 before each kernel launch.
	// 
	// To simulate multiple samples per frame and reduce CPU overhead, we can launch multiple times the kernels per frame.
	// We would thus need to reset the status buffer before each kernel launch but this is a synchronous operation which then
	// slows down the UI. This means that we cannot reset the status buffer before each kernel launch, we can only reset it
	// at each frame before GPURenderer::render() is called.
	// 
	// In the case where we have 5 samples per pixel for example, we would have each kernel launch increment the status
	// buffer and that would largely go above 100% of pixels converged (which doesn't make sense).
