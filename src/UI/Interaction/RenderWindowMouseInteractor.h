/**
 * This class is derived in a LinuxRenderWindowMouseInteractor and a WindowsRenderWindowMouseInteractor.
 * 
 * This is because GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED seems to be buggued on Windows. There's some kind of annoying 
 * cursor jumping happening. 
 * 
 * Therefore, a "custom" solution that forcefully repositions the cursor at its previous position 
 * has been implemented to provide unlimited movement (otherwise the cursor would end up getting 
 * out of the window). On Linux, it seemed that glfwSetCursorPosition had no effect (my cursor 
 * wasn't being repositionned at all during my testing). However, on Linux, there's no cursor 
 * jumping with GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED so we can use that (using the same implementation as Windows 
 * is broken anyways because, again, glfwSetCursorPosition, which is used by the Windows implementation, 
 * has no effect). 
 * 
 * This is why we have 2 different implementations:
 * 
 *  - Windows uses a replacement implementation to GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED that manually
 *      repositions the cursor using glfwSetCursorPosition
 *  - Linux uses GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED (we could have used only the Windows implementation but
 *      glfwSetCursorPosition doesn't seemed to be working during my testing on Linux)
